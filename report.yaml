product_narrative: |
  When you shop online there are a number of things you think about before purchasing an item: price, quality, the time it will take to
  arrive, etc. But very few people consider the impact this purchase has on the environment -- the product's carbon footprint. 
  We're building a browser application that allows you to compare products based on their carbon footprint while shopping online and gives
  you an opportunity to offset the carbon cost of your purchase with a carbon offset.
